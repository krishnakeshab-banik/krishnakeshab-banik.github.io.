<article><h3>As a motivated and driven individual, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to challenge myself and grow both personally and professionally. My name is Krishna Keshab Banik and I am currently pursuing a Btech degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at SRM University in Chennai.

    My passion for technology and problem solving has led me to choose a career path in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I believe that with the right use of AI, we can solve complex problems and contribute to the development of society. I am always eager to learn and explore new techniques and technologies in this ever-evolving field.
    
    Having completed my schooling from Indus Valley World School in Kolkata, I have developed a strong foundation in academics and extracurricular activities. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and gain practical experience in the industry.
    
    Apart from my academic pursuits, I am a huge cricket fan. I believe that sports teach us important lessons such as teamwork, determination, and discipline, which are essential for personal and professional growth.
    
    I am now looking forward to working on innovative and challenging projects that will allow me to apply my knowledge and skills in a practical setting. I am confident that my problem-solving abilities, coupled with my passion for technology, will enable me to achieve more in life. </h3></article>
